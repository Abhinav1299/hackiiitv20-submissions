## Online Education
Education in rural areas has never seen a leverage in teaching styles.
Lack of Good Teachers and old teaching methods made it even worse in the pandemic.
Skilled teachers have loction barriers and hasitate to reach the rural areas.
Everybody carries a mobile phone, in rural as well as urban areas.
Our idea is to troubleshoot the problem of one way communication in online meets, where one speaks and shows.
What we will be working on is a realtime application where live streaming of white boards will be done in a chat room.
While streaming one has a capture button, that will binarise the image.
This will send a binarized image to all users who open same URL using websocket
We will try to make the background transparent and display camera image under the binarized image.
Now a student can project the outlines on a piece of paper and himself do some changes in the image and send the overlaid image back.
This will work turn by turn and a blackboard chat system will be formed.

This would be hard to implement completly, but can be given a good try.
